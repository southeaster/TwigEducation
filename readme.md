# Twig Education Coding Challenge
## Background

A simple project in response to Twig Education's coding challenge. This is only to demonstrate my understanding of Javascript.

For this challenge I chose to create a basic npm package with no dependencies. Only a single index.js file containig the ```groupArrayElements``` function as described in the challenge and a single tests.js file for testing.

## Installation

No installation required apart from Nodejs (I used version V12.16.1) and the files in this repository.

## Testing

Just run 
```
npm run test
```
